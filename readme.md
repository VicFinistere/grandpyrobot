> Using Google Maps and Wikipedia API  to answer about localisation <br>

Usage of the web application : A conversational place finder ! 


## The app is  french ! "Où est la place ...?" 

For example, let's be french students : "Où est Openclassroom's ?"<br>
We could made it with a longer sentence: "Est-ce que tu connais l'adresse de Openclassroom's Grandpy s'il te plaît ?
" ... not necessary of course ! 

<small>Carefull even we could translate the web page your questions have to be in french but it's also working with keywords. So you can enter a city's name and it will be fine !</small>

## Presentation
The application is easy to understand. There is an input text where you can write your request as it's said in the french examples just above. Your cursor will be automatically placed in it when loading the web page. There is an example you could test in the placeholder. Sending your request is simple you can do it by clicking the button or pressing the enter key on keyboards. Both methods will work on every media. So you can do it on smartphone, tablet, small device, largest one... Thanks to Bootstrap !

## Fun to use
The application is made with Python Programming language.<small>(fun and easy !)<br></small>
It's made with a simple & beautifull Boostrap template : "Cover" ! <br>
<small>( And it's JQuery and CSS animated !)</small>
